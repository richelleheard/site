        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<body>
    <p style="color: blue;">My journey as an artist has always felt like it has been on pause. The more I put it to the side, the less creative I get. At the moment, I am learning to express myself again. From what I wear to what I put on a canvas. I have always loved to draw and now I am at a point in my life where I want to be able to make art that has meaning. Itâ€™s easy for me to see something and be able to make an exact replica of it, but now I am starting to venture out and create my own artwork. To me, my art allows me to describe myself in a way that has no filter. I use art to create things that are true to who I am and what I want in life.
